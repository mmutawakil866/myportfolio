For this, I chose Cloudflare Pages. ðŸš€\nWhat is Cloudflare Pages? #Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for deploying static websites directly from your GitHub or GitLab repository. It automatically builds and deploys your site whenever you push changes â€” no servers to manage, no manual uploads.\nSome benefits include:\nFree and fast global CDN Automatic builds with continuous integration (CI) Continuous deployment (CD) for every push Easy GitHub/GitLab integration Steps I Followed #1. Linked My GitHub Account #On the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, I linked my GitHub account so that Cloudflare could access my repositories.\n2. Selected My Repository #From the list of repositories, I selected the one that contained my Hugo + Congo portfolio.\n3. Configured Build Settings #Cloudflare Pages recognized that my site used Hugo. I simply confirmed the defaults:\nFramework preset: Hugo Build command: hugo Output directory: public 4. Continuous Integration + Deployment #The best part: I donâ€™t have to deploy manually anymore. Cloudflare Pages automatically:\nRuns the build process whenever I push changes to GitHub Deploys the updated version to a global CDN Provides a live URL and even preview deployments for branches The Result #Within a few minutes, my portfolio was live on the web â€” and every update I push to GitHub now goes live automatically. ðŸ™Œ\nThis setup makes it easy for me to focus on writing content and improving my site, while Cloudflare handles deployment in the background.\nâœ… Next, Iâ€™ll be writing about how I plan to organize and publish posts here â€” stay tuned!\n","date":"13 September 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/deploying-to-cloudflare/","section":"Blogs","summary":"How I deployed my Hugo + Congo portfolio using Cloudflare Pages.","title":"Deploying My Portfolio with Cloudflare Pages"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/deployment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deployment"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/","section":"mmutawakil","summary":"","title":"mmutawakil"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/portfolio/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Portfolio"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Iâ€™m really excited to share my very first portfolio website, built with Hugo and the Congo theme. ðŸŽ‰\nThis portfolio is a big step for me â€” it will serve as a place to showcase my projects, write posts, and share my journey in tech.\nWhy Hugo + Congo? # Hugo is a super-fast static site generator.
